 # Credit Risk Prediction Project 



## **Problem Statement**
Financial institutions frequently encounter challenges in accurately evaluating the creditworthiness of loan applicants. Inaccurate assessments can lead to significant financial losses and increased risk exposure. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution that predicts whether an applicant is likely to be a good or bad credit risk based on their profile attributes, thereby assisting financial institutions in making informed and strategic lending decisions.



## **Abstract**
This project presents a **web-based Credit Risk Prediction system** built using machine learning algorithms and deployed through **Streamlit** for interactive use. Leveraging the **German Credit Dataset**, we performed comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation across various classification models. The final deliverable is a user-friendly web application that allows users to input applicant details and obtain real-time credit risk predictions.



## **Dataset Description**
We utilized the **German Credit Dataset**, comprising 1000 samples, with the following key features:

- **Age** (numeric)
- **Sex** (categorical: male, female)
- **Job** (numeric: 0 - unskilled and non-resident, 1 - unskilled and resident, 2 - skilled, 3 - highly skilled)
- **Housing** (categorical: own, rent, free)
- **Saving accounts** (categorical: little, moderate, quite rich, rich)
- **Checking account** (numeric, balance in Deutsch Marks)
- **Credit amount** (numeric, in Deutsch Marks)
- **Duration** (numeric, loan term in months)
- **Purpose** (categorical: car, furniture/equipment, radio/TV, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, vacation/others)

The target variable is the applicantâ€™s **credit risk** (Good or Bad).


## **Methodology**

### **Data Preprocessing**
- Imputed missing values in **Saving accounts** and **Checking account** features by assigning appropriate categories ('unknown').
- Performed **label encoding** to convert categorical features into numerical format.
- Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical attributes, ensuring consistency across features.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Conducted detailed visualizations and analysis to understand feature distributions and relationships with the target variable.
- Key insights identified:
  - Applicants aged below 25 exhibited a slightly higher tendency toward bad credit risk.
  - Higher credit amounts combined with longer loan durations correlated strongly with bad credit outcomes.
  - A 'little' balance in checking accounts was a common trait among bad credit applicants.

### **Model Training and Evaluation**
We evaluated multiple classification algorithms, including:
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**
- **Linear Regression** (although Linear Regression is generally more suited for continuous output, it was adapted here for comparative purposes)

Performance was assessed using:
- **Accuracy**
- **ROC AUC Score**
- **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**



### **Best Performing Model**
The **XGBoost Classifier** emerged as the best-performing model, achieving:

- **Accuracy**: **76%**
- **ROC AUC Score**: **0.775**

Its robustness and superior generalization ability made it the ideal choice for deployment.



## **Streamlit Web Application**
A fully interactive web application was developed using **Streamlit**, providing a seamless experience across three major sections:

- **Home**: Introduces the project and displays key insights and visualizations.
- **EDA**: Presents data exploration findings through intuitive plots and graphs.
- **Predict**: Allows users to input applicant information and obtain real-time credit risk predictions.

### **Key Features:**
- Simple and clean user interface for ease of use.
- User input forms capturing all essential applicant details.
- On-the-fly data preprocessing and scaling using the pre-fitted scaler.
- Instantaneous display of the prediction result and probability, supporting confident decision-making.



## **Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning in the domain of credit risk assessment. Among the evaluated models, the **XGBoost Classifier** exhibited superior predictive performance and was chosen for deployment. The resulting **Streamlit web application** is intuitive, efficient, and offers real-time risk predictions, making it a valuable asset for financial institutions aiming to enhance their loan approval processes and mitigate credit risks.
